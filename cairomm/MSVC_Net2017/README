Building cairomm-1.16 with Visual Studio .NET 2017

* You will need Visual Studio 2017 (MSVC 15.0).  Building with Visual Studio 2015 or earlier is no longer supported.
* Install the latest Win32 GTK+ Development files from ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtk+/ and add
  the paths to headers and import libraries to Visual Studio, if they are not already in $(srcroot)/../vs15/$(Platform).
* Load the MSVC_Net2017/cairomm.sln solution.
* Build the entire solution.
* Run the tests.
